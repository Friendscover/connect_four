# Connect Four
This is my take on the Classical Game "Connect Four" in Ruby.

The Game can be played in the command line.

This was made as part of the Odin Projects Full Stack Curriculum and was written in TDD Style. 

Check it out at [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/testing-your-ruby-code) !

Run it from the main directory.
```
ruby lib/game.rb
```
